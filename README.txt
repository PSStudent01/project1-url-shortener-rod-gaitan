## Overview

### The challenge
All of the following were completed to the best of my ability within the amount of time provided:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process
- gathered all necessary documentation from Frontend Mentor
- Read all documents, instructions carefully, including thos eof the API website "Bitly"
- Drafted a "doodling map" of the layout and style to start the html (includedin this folder)
- then started coding, testing and troubleshooting along the way 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Flexbox



### What I learned
- This was a phenomenal way to reinforce what we've learned so far
-- how devastating responsiveness can be when you do not constantly check it as you move along.
-- I was initially planning on doing javascript on one file but I see a huge value in been able  to breakup you project into different modules that serve a particular purpose
--- Effectively integrating the API, fetching from a live site and seen the magic at play was awesome
- also got a chace to reinforce:
--- Application interactivity – highly interactive with features like search, form validation, dynamic content updates
--- Accessibility – semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
--- Version control / Git practices – frequent, clear, descriptive commits following best practices
